# Medical-Text-Classification
This is a personal project where I will use different Natural Language Processing tools and Machine Learning models to classify medical text.

The dataset employed was download from the git repository: https://github.com/sebischair/medical-abstracts-tc-corpus and it created was for the following paper:

Tim Schopf, Daniel Braun, and Florian Matthes. 2022. Evaluating Unsupervised Text Classification: Zero-shot and Similarity-based Approaches. In 2022 6th International Conference on Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval (NLPIR 2022), December 16â€“18, 2022, Bangkok, Thailand. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 10 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3582768.3582795
